# Neural-Networks-VS-Traditional-algorithms
Training both a linear softmax classifier and a 2 layer neural network on a 2D-Toy dataset. We noticed that there was only a trivial change in the code when we shifted from a linear classifier to a 2 layer neural network. Although, in the case of the 2 layer neural network, there was an additional step of backpropogation from the hidden layer to the initial first layer but it significantly increased the test set classification accuracy as well.
